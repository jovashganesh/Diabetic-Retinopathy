const String EXPLANATION = "Diabetes is a lifelong condition where the person’s body is unable to regulate blood glucose levels in their bloodstream which causes the blood glucose levels to stay consistently high. This can damage blood vessels, which can damage organs if it is left untreated. \n \n One of the issues with diabetes is that millions of people go undiagnosed, as there are no clear early symptoms of diabetes. Unregulated blood sugar levels will slowly damage the blood vessels of the person’s eyes. However, because there are no obvious symptoms until it has heavily advanced, the person would not notice anything until it has become a very serious problem. \n \n One way to circumvent this is to have annual eye screening and check up with an ophthalmologist for those without diabetes, or every 6 months for someone who has diabetes. Ophthalmologists use a special type of lens to look through the pupils of the patient and capture an image of the retina which can be analysed for symptoms that show the presence of diabetic retinopathy . \n \n This app aims to autonomously detect the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy by analysing an image of the retina and giving a prediction ";
